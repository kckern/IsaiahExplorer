The reproof would not have been sufficiently powerful to affect their minds, if he had not also threatened punishment; and therefore he now declares that the heinous offense, of having wickedly imposed on him, will not escape vengeance. Now the punishment to be inflicted on them amounts to this, that they will be deprived of the gifts which they had abused, when God shall not only withdraw his care of them, but shall give them up to be plundered by their enemies. At the same time he shows how wretched their condition will be, when God shall have ceased to bestow on them his multiplied favors. <\/p>\n<p>Hence it follows that it must have been owing entirely to the extraordinary goodness of God, that the <i>vineyard <\/i>remained safe and uninjured till that time. He goes so far as to point out the various supports by which it was upheld, and the vast resources which God possesses for destroying it both within and without; for when his protection has been removed, they must become a prey to all that pass by, whether men or beasts. \u201cWhen the fence has been removed,\u201d says he, \u201cthe cattle will tread on it and lay it bare, robbers will ransack and plunder it, and thus it will become a wilderness.\u201d <\/p>",
