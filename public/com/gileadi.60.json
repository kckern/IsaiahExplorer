    "html": "<p>By again using the covenant formula &ldquo;his people,&rdquo; Jehovah shows his intent to care for his people in spite of their leaders&rsquo; lack of care. The term&rsquo;s parallel occurrence with the &ldquo;needy&rdquo; denotes Jehovah&rsquo;s regard for the oppressed. They, above all others&mdash;not the elite who wield authority over them&mdash;are &ldquo;his people&rdquo; (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjcwXQ==\">v 15<\/a>). Whereas the wealthy and powerful fall prey to pride, the needy&rsquo;s lowly circumstances keep them humble. The &ldquo;vineyard&rdquo; their leaders devour&mdash;by feeding on their taxes and tithes&mdash;represents Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people, those whom Jehovah chooses as his own (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 5:7<\/a>).<\/p>",
