He therefore reproaches the Jews with having labored much and long in seeking the assistance of the wicked; that is, with having attempted to bring the Egyptians against the Assyrians, and next, when they had been disappointed of their hope, with having begun to betake themselves to the Babylonians. When their hearts have been estranged from God, they seek assistance from another quarter, and by great labor and expense bring upon themselves severer distresses. Yet while the Lord grants repose to his people, that they may perform their work in peace, wicked men \u201cvex themselves in vain, rise early, go late to rest, eat the bread of sorrow,\u201d as it is said, (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 127:2<\/a>) and yet do not gain a farthing, because all that they do is without God\u2019s authority or guidance. But the Spirit inflicts on them this punishment, so that they incessantly wander and are tossed about in doubt and uncertainty, and never can find rest in their minds. <\/p> ",
