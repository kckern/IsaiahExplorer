    "html": " <p> <i>Wilt thou restrain thyself for these things, O Jehovah? <\/i> The people strengthen themselves by assured confidence, that God will not permit his glory to be trampled under foot, though men provoke him by innumerable transgressions. This can yield no consolation of any kind to hypocrites, but relates solely to those who are moved by a true sense of the mercy of God. Such persons believe and are fully persuaded, though death threaten them, that God will nevertheless have regard to his own glow, and will at least be gracious to the remnant, that the seed may not perish. <\/p> \n <p> <i>And wilt thou afflict us beyond measure? <\/i> He shews that it is impossible for God not to be mindful of his mercy; for \u201che cannot deny himself.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">2 Timothy 2:13<\/a>.) But our salvation is connected with his glory. This ought to be carefully observed; for, after having spoken of the glory of God, he adds, \u201cThou wilt not afflict us beyond measure.\u201d The Lord will therefore restrain his chastisements; for his glory, which he cannot disregard, is deeply involved in our deliverance from death. To this prayer, therefore, let us betake ourselves whenever we are attacked by our enemies; not in the manner of hypocrites, (who haughtily boast of the glory of God, of which they have no experience whatever,) but with repentance and faith, that we may actually obtain the fruit of that glory. <\/p> ",
