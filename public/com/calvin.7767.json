And indeed it is God who drives them headlong, and rouses them to rage, so that they tum against themselves that strength which they formerly exerted against the Church, fight with each other, as the Midianites did, and bring destruction on themselves. (<a class=\"ref\">Jude 7:22 <\/a>.) The meaning amounts to this, that there will be no need of outward aid or of any preparations, when God shall determine to overtum and destroy the reprobate; because, having been struck by him with giddiness, they shall wear themselves out in mutual conflict by the insatiable rage with which they shall attack each other. <\/p> \n <p> <i>And all flesh shall know. <\/i> He repeats that statement which we have formerly seen, namely, that he will be acknowledged by all to be the God of Israel and the true and only God, when he shall have delivered his people from destruction; for he intended it to be a demonstration of his Divinity, that he openly manifested himself to be the Redeemer and Savior of his people. <\/p> \n <p> <i>The Mighty One of Jacob. <\/i> Some read the word <i>Jacob <\/i> in the vocative case: \u201cO mighty Jacob;\u201d but I read it in the genitive case, \u201cof Jacob.\u201d The Lord testifies that he is the Savior, Redeemer, and Mighty One of Israel, that they may rely with their whole heart on his defense and protection. <\/p> ",
