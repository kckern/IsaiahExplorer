    "html": "<p><i>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? <\/i>It is supposed that <i>Hamath <\/i>was Antioch in Syria, that <i>Arpad <\/i>was that city from which colonies were brought to Damascus, and that <i>Sepharvaim <\/i>was a city situated in the country of Damascus. If this be true, Rabshakeh mentions the ancient names of cities, from which many nations had formerly come, and which afterwards lost not only their celebrity, but likewise their distinctive names, and aims at producing in them greater alarm, by reminding them of so great revolutions. However that may be, he mentions chiefly the neighboring cities, the destruction of which might affect them more deeply on account of their being better known to the Jews. And I have no doubt that these places belonged to Syria and Israel; as if he had said, \u201cLook at these two kingdoms subdued, which were presided over by their gods as their guardians. Will your God resist me?\u201d <\/p>",
