As a linear holistic structure, Trouble at Home, Exile Abroad, and Happy Homecoming follows a timeline reaching from Isaiah\u2019s day to the end of the world.|A national consciousness pervades the first part of this threefold structure as Israel dwells in the land God promised Israel\u2019s ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. A universal consciousness pervades the second part as Israel\u2019s twelve tribes spread throughout the earth, populating new lands and intermarrying with other nations. An individual consciousness pervades the third part as only persons who renew God\u2019s covenant respond to his end\u2013time summons to return home.|A redeeming aspect of Israel\u2019s dispersion among the nations of the world is that through the assimilation and intermingling of Israelite lineages with gentile or non\u2013Israelite peoples, all nations of the world can now lay claim to Israel\u2019s covenantal heritage. Repentant persons of all nations, in other words, may renew the covenant with the God of Israel and reap its abundant blessings. God thus turns evil to good on behalf of those who love him and desire to serve him."

This shows that to ascend to higher spiritual levels a person or nation of God\u2019s people must descend through trials, prove loyal to God under all conditions, and comply with his law and word while resisting the temptation to be disloyal or rebel.|According to this pattern, the higher a person or nation ascends spiritually, the greater the preceding descent through trials that test their loyalty. In each case, a higher law and word of God must be observed in order to ascend further. Every ascent is characterized by God\u2019s re\u2013creating the candidate nearer to his own image and likeness. It is accompanied by the candidate\u2019s receiving a new name pertaining to the new spiritual level and by an appointment to a higher spiritual calling.|As a synchronous holistic structure\u2014in which all parts of the text interconnect concurrently or synchronously\u2014Isaiah\u2019s Seven\u2013Part Structure transforms the entire Book of Isaiah into an apocalyptic or end\u2013time prophecy. In that sense, Israel\u2019s ancient history, as selectively represented in the Book of Isaiah, functions as an allegory of the end\u2013time, in which the names of ancient persons and nations act as codenames of persons and nations that exist at the end of the world."
